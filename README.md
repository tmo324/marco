# MARCO (Marine Autonomous Robotic COmmunicator)

The goal is to build a Linux powered autonomous boat, named MARCO (Marine Autonomous Robotic COmmunicator), that can travel anywhere in the world. Raspberry Pi is used to power MARCO. MARCO will travel autonomously using GPS tracking and custom code built by us.

The design will be based off a surf board to minimize the risk of it capsizing. MARCO will have one propeller as its source of momentum. A rudder, custom built by us, will steer MARCO to its final destination. MARCO will be powered by a battery that is charged by solar         panels.

## Code
This is the embedded code that runs on the Raspberry Pi that controls MARCO. It was written in Python.

## Graphing and collecting
These are scripts/lines for performing automatic data acquisition from the solar panels.
